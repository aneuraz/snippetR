	abstract = {In statistics, the Freedman–Diaconis rule can be used to select the size of the bins to be used in a histogram. It is named after David A. Freedman and Persi Diaconis. 
For a set of empirical measurements sampled from some probability distribution, the Freedman-Diaconis rule is designed to minimize the difference between the area under the empirical probability distribution and the area under the theoretical probability distribution.The general equation for the rule is:

  
    
      
        
          Bin size
        
        =
        2
        
        
          
            
              
                IQR
              
              (
              x
              )
            
            
              
                n
                
                  3
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle \{{\textbackslash}text\{Bin size\}\}=2{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{IQR\}\}(x) {\textbackslash}over \{{\textbackslash}sqrt[\{3\}]\{n\}\}\}\}
  where 
  
    
      
        IQR
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}operatorname \{IQR\} (x)\}

        n
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle n\}
   is the number of observations in the sample
